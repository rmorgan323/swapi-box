## SwapiBox

SwapiBox is a solo project created by myself, Rob Morgan for Turing School of Software & Design in a period of one week.  It is built in React, tested with Jest/Enzyme, and pulls data from the Star Wars API.

On load, a user sees the famous Star Wars opening crawl randomly selected from any of the Star Wars movies and then has the ability to click on different categories and favorite items in those categories.  When favorited, an item is lightly highlighted blue and a star in the corner goes from a faded outline to a solid blue.  As well, a user can view all favorited items.

This was my first project using nested fetch calls.

The styling is my own and the app displays well on all screen sizes.

Then users can view data about various items from the movies, in this case, worlds.  Worlds can be favorited and will be added to a favorites page as a result.
